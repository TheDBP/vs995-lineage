# Debugging a boot loop

A port that hangs on the boot animation and reboots itself is a `system_server` crash loop.

## Order

1. Boot to recovery, pull `/data/tombstones`. **Not pstore.**
2. Only if that is empty, pull `console-ramoops-0` and `pmsg-ramoops-0`.
3. If pmsg has no tombstone and no Java `FATAL EXCEPTION`, stop reading logs and get live adb.

## Tombstones first

| | `/data/tombstones` | pmsg-ramoops |
|---|---|---|
| Survives cold power-off | yes | **no** |
| Loses the first crash | no | **yes, quickly** |
| Names faulting library and function | **yes** | only if the record survived |
| Holds every crash of every process | **yes** | last few seconds only |

From TWRP, where adb needs no authorisation:

```sh
adb shell mount /data
adb pull /data/tombstones ./diag/
```

Census before reading any single one:

```sh
for f in tombstone_[0-9]*; do case "$f" in *.pb) continue;; esac
  echo "$(grep -aoE '^signal [0-9]+ \([A-Z]+\)' "$f" | head -1) | $(grep -aoE '^Cmdline: .*' "$f" | head -1)"
done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

## Why pstore misleads

pstore survives a reboot but not a cold power-off, and the pmsg ring is 256K–512K
(`android,ramoops-pmsg-size`). A loop wraps it many times, so what remains is the tail of the last
cycle — real-looking errors, none causal.

- Don't conclude from a logged exception that it was thrown. `getServiceOrThrow` appears in the stack
  trace of a caught-and-logged warning exactly as it does in a crash. Read the AOSP source.
- Don't chase `zygote received signal 9`. `SigChldHandler` has zygote SIGKILL *itself* when
  system_server dies. One per loop iteration is expected and says only that system_server died.
- Don't chase a restarting service nothing binds to.

## Live adb instead

`adbd` and `logd` do not depend on `system_server`, so they run through the loop.

**First check USB adb can work on this kernel.** adbd drives FunctionFS with AIO, which arrived in
Linux 3.15. Older kernels return `EINVAL` and the host sees a device stuck `offline`:

```sh
grep -A12 'ffs_epfile_operations' <kernel>/drivers/usb/gadget/f_fs.c   # no .aio_read/.aio_write = impossible
```

AOSP removed the blocking fallback when adb became a mainline module, so there is no property to
flip — backport FFS AIO, or restore a blocking path in adbd.

**Wireless adb is unaffected** — plain TCP, never touches FunctionFS. On an old-kernel device it is
the cheaper route, but networking has to work first.

If USB adb is viable, two things block it:

**adbd never starts.** `sys.usb.config` stays `none` until the framework sets it, and a crashing
system_server never gets there.

```make
PRODUCT_PROPERTY_OVERRIDES += persist.sys.usb.config=adb
```

**adb wants authorisation.** On `userdebug` `ro.adb.secure=1`, and a crashing system_server cannot
draw the prompt. Ship your host key:

```make
PRODUCT_ADB_KEYS := device/<vendor>/<codename>/adb_keys.pub
```

Copy `~/.android/adbkey.pub` there. Gated to `eng`/`userdebug` in `product_config.mk`, so it cannot
leak into a `user` build.

> Mark that patch TEMPORARY and revert before distributing. It grants one machine adb access to every
> device running the build.

```sh
adb wait-for-device logcat -b all > loop.txt
```

## More pmsg ring, if needed

Rebalance the existing reservation rather than touching the memory map:

```
buffer-size 0x200000 = console 0x100000 + ftrace 0x10000 + pmsg 0x80000 + <dump records>
```

- Do move slack from dump records to pmsg. `console-ramoops` already has the kernel state.
- Don't set a zone to `0` on pre-4.x kernels. Shrink it instead.

## Once you can see

1. Native crash in system_server (tombstone) — the real answer if present
2. Uncaught Java exception during a boot phase
3. A HAL blocking `getService()` forever — `tools/check-hal-readiness.sh`
4. Watchdog kill (60 s; find the blocked lock)

Everything else is noise until those four are clear.
