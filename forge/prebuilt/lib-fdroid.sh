# lib-fdroid.sh — fetch the build F-Droid currently suggests for a package, trusting the signer,
# not a file hash. Source it; then:
#
#   fdroid_fetch_latest PKG OUT SIGNER_SHA256 [LABEL]
#
# Resolves PKG's suggestedVersionCode from the F-Droid API, downloads that APK to OUT unless OUT
# already is that version, and accepts it only if
#   - aapt2 reports the package name PKG,
#   - if it carries native code at all, some of it is arm64-v8a (an armeabi-only build would
#     install and then crash; a pure-Java build is fine),
#   - apksigner verifies it and the first signer certificate's sha256 is SIGNER_SHA256.
# The signer pin is what makes "latest" safe: the key is the one thing that does not change between
# releases, and it is checked over the whole file (v2/v3 signature), so a tampered or truncated
# download fails here. To get a new signing key accepted, change the pin on purpose.
#
# FDROID_PINS="pkg=versionCode pkg=versionCode" pins packages to one exact build instead (to
# reproduce a release, or to hold back a known-bad update). Anything not listed stays on latest.
#
# Offline: if the API cannot be reached but OUT exists and verifies, it is used with a warning; a
# missing or bad OUT is an error. Runs in-container: needs curl, unzip, and the tree's aapt2, JDK
# and apksigner.jar (AOSP in $AOSP, default /aosp).
#
# The fetchers build on it with:
#
#   fdroid_stage PKG APK SIGNER_SHA256 LABEL LIBDIR
#       fetch_latest, then classify the APK (fdroid_apk_libs_loadable) and, if its native libraries
#       cannot be loaded out of the archive, unpack lib/arm64-v8a/*.so to LIBDIR/lib/arm64-v8a/ for
#       the module to install beside the APK. Sets FDROID_UNPACKED=yes|no.
#   fdroid_bp_wanted DIR
#       true when DIR/.gitignore lists /Android.bp: the branch's patch ships no module file and the
#       fetcher writes it. (20.0 patches ship Android.mk and no such line; a branch with no patch
#       for the option has no .gitignore, so nothing is written where nothing is built.)
#   fdroid_bp_begin FILE WRITER; fdroid_bp_module FILE NAME APK PKG UNPACKED [EXTRA_PROPERTY...]
#       write the Soong module file: header, then one android_app_import per call.
#       skip_preprocessed_apk_checks is set exactly when UNPACKED=yes, which is what Soong's check
#       demands (it fails the build if the flag is set on an APK that passes, or missing on one that
#       does not).
