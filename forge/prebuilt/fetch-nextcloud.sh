# fetch-nextcloud.sh — download the Nextcloud bundle for the nextcloud option: the build F-Droid

#   ./fetch-nextcloud.sh [AOSP_ROOT]
# FDROID_PINS="com.nextcloud.talk2=240000094 ..." holds any of them to one build.
#
# Each APK ships byte for byte, so what its author packed decides how it is wired, per fetch:
#   - native libraries compressed or unaligned in the APK (NC Passwords today; any of them after some
#     release) -> lib/arm64-v8a/*.so unpacked to <App>/lib/arm64-v8a/ beside it, which the branch's
#     module installs as app/<App>/lib/arm64/. PackageManager does not extract native libraries for
#     a bundled app, so without this the app dies at launch in UnsatisfiedLinkError.
#   - on Soong branches (22.2+; the patch's .gitignore lists /Android.bp) the module file is
#     WRITTEN here, Android.bp, gitignored: skip_preprocessed_apk_checks has to be set on exactly
#     the APKs Soong's check fails, and Soong refuses it on one that passes, so a static file cannot
#     be right across releases. 20.0's Android.mk needs no per-app knowledge (a wildcard on the
#     unpacked libraries) and comes from the patch.
