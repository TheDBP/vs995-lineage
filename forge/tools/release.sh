# Why this exists rather than `gh release upload`:
#
# A ROM built with WITH_OEM=true contains a manufacturer's boot animation, wallpapers and system
# sounds, reclaimed from their firmware. Running that on a phone you own is uncontroversial.
# Publishing it is redistribution of someone else's copyrighted assets, and the realistic
# consequence is not a letter to you -- it is a DMCA notice to whoever hosts the file, landing on
# the account that also holds every one of your repos.
#
# The two builds differ by one flag and their filenames differ by one word. So publishing goes
# through here, and here refuses anything that is not provably clean:
#
#   1. the preset's option set must contain neither gapps nor oem
#   2. the build's recorded provenance must agree
#   3. the built tree is scanned for OEM assets and GApps packages that should not be there
#   4. the release name is checked for trademarks you did not mean to put on a download page
#   5. the image is signed with your keys, not AOSP's public test keys
#
# Any one of those failing stops the release. None of them are skippable by accident.

Unofficial LineageOS build for \`$DEVICE_CODENAME\`, branch \`$BRANCH\`, preset \`$VN\`.

**What is in it:** LineageOS plus the options this preset selected.

**What is not:** no Google apps, and none of the manufacturer's own boot animation, wallpapers or
system sounds. Those are theirs, not mine, so they are not mine to hand out. If you want them on
your phone, the build system can put them back from a copy of your phone's own stock firmware --
see \`forge/docs/OEM-ASSETS.md\`.

Like every Android ROM, this contains proprietary vendor firmware for the hardware to work at all.

**Installing:** ${RECOVERY_ASSET:+\`fastboot flash recovery $(basename "$RECOVERY_ASSET")\`, }boot into recovery,
*Factory reset*, then *Apply update → ADB sideload* the zip, reboot. Updating from an earlier one of
these builds: sideload the new zip, no wipe. $RECOVERY_NOTE

No warranty. It wipes your phone. You already knew that.
