# rom-forge tools

Port-assessment scripts, plus the machinery `bootstrap.sh` calls.

Bash and `grep`/`awk`/`comm`. Need a synced tree, not a built one. Run on the host or in the
container.

## Quick reference

| tool | run it | what you get |
|---|---|---|
| `check-platform-support.sh` | before porting | what upstream no longer gives this SoC — the cheapest, most predictive check |
| `find-orphaned-sepolicy-types.sh` | before porting | SELinux types the device references that the new branch deleted |
| `find-removed-platform-symbols.sh` | before porting | C/C++ platform constants it lost |
| `find-soong-namespace-drift.sh` | before porting | Soong namespaces the device must now import, modules and HIDL libraries the branch deleted (including what the blobs link against), makefile paths that moved |
| `triage-build-log.sh` | after a failed build | a wall of errors collapsed into a few classes |
| `check-image-labels.sh` | when packaging fails | every unlabeled path at once, instead of one per build |
| `ota-extract.sh` | when you need a reference ROM | partitions out of a signed A/B OTA, and optionally flashed to one slot so you can keep a known-good build on the inactive slot |
| `slot-switch.sh` | when you need the other slot's ROM to boot | the device moved to the other slot with the shared `/data` wiped and the setup wizard skipped, because the older ROM stops booting once the newer one has initialised user 0 |
| `blob-attach.sh` | when a prebuilt HAL crashes | a vendor binary under `lldb-server` with its library load base printed, so absolute breakpoints work in a stripped blob |
| `boot-window-logcat.sh` | when a boot ends in a reboot | the logcat, dmesg and properties of each window adbd is reachable, one set per appearance — the route that does not depend on the ramoops region surviving the reboot |
| `repack-erofs-apex.sh` | when a prebuilt APEX will not mount | that apex rebuilt with an ext4 payload and re-signed, for a kernel with no CONFIG_EROFS_FS -- apexd's "No such device" with everything inside the apex silently absent |
| `make-apex-key.sh` | before the first EROFS repack | the four-file signing key that repack needs, made once on the host because KEYS_DIR is read-only in the container |
| `unpack-block-ota.sh` | when flashing | partition images out of a `payload.bin` OTA, for fastboot-only flashing |
| `check-sigpipe.sh` | before committing | pipelines that will die silently under `set -o pipefail` |
| `dev-shell.sh` | any time | an interactive shell in the build container |
| `make-keys.sh` | once, before the first release | signing keys in a directory outside every repo; point `KEYS_DIR` at it in `device.conf.local` |
| `new-device-repo.sh` | once, at the start | scaffolds a device repo, vendors `forge/`, and with `--codename` fills in `device.conf` and the local manifest by looking the device up |

Called for you by `bootstrap.sh`, listed here so you know what they are:

| tool | what it does |
|---|---|
| `apply-overlay.sh` | installs local_manifests, applies the selected options and this device's patches, vendors recovered trees (`VENDORED_PROJECTS`), merges kernel fragments (`KERNEL_EXTRA_CONFIGS`) and kernel patches (`KERNEL_EXTRA_PATCHES`) |
| `extract-gapps-apps.sh` | matches APKs in a GApps zip by package name via aapt2, stages them as `android_app_import` prebuilts with `overrides:` so they replace the Lineage equivalents |
| `release.sh` | publishes the redistributable preset and refuses anything else — see [docs/RELEASING.md](../docs/RELEASING.md) |
| `run-one.sh` | builds one device repo and refuses if another build is already running; timestamped log, one start/finish line for a queue to read |
| `extract-nextbit-oem-assets.sh` | pulls sounds, wallpapers and the boot animation out of a Nextbit Robin stock ROM (nav-bar icons are the `nav-icons` option, redrawn, not extracted) (`OEM_ASSET_PACK=nextbit-robin`) — see [docs/OEM-ASSETS.md](../docs/OEM-ASSETS.md) |
| `sync-forge.sh` | vendors `forge/` into a device repo at a pinned commit |
| `refresh-patches.sh` | regenerates `overlay/patches` from your commits — **clean tree only** (GOTCHAS 14) |
| `measure-touch-rate.sh` | how fast the touchscreen really reports, measured inside one contact on the real digitizer — injected input never reaches it (GOTCHAS 25) |
| `bench-launch.sh` | cold app-launch times over adb (min/median/max of N runs) — for A/B-ing a tuning change on one phone, meaningless across phones or ROMs |
| `symbolize-odex-pcs.py` | names the bare `services.odex` PCs in an ANR/tombstone native dump from an oatdump listing — dex-preopted framework code ships without debug info, so debuggerd prints only file offsets |
| `check-hal-readiness.sh` | HALs the manifest declares with nothing to serve them — finds them before a build-flash-boot cycle does |
| `check-bpf-readiness.sh` | what a kernel without eBPF (or other modern syscalls) will break; `--src` scans code, `--log` reads what the device actually got |
| `propagate-forge.sh` | pushes an engine change out to every device repo beside this one, fast-forwarding each branch to its remote first |
| `kernel-rebuild.sh` | boot image only, ~20 min, with the last full build's exact option set (`out/.turbo_config`) so `out/` neither reconfigures nor installcleans; `--am <patch>` puts an overlay kernel patch on the live tree first |

Bringing a kernel up to a newer branch (the *kernel gate* of a port — see
[docs/porting-a-branch-bump.md](../docs/porting-a-branch-bump.md)), in the order you reach for them:

| tool | run it | what you get |
|---|---|---|
| `check-bpf-objects.py` | before the first boot, on the built `.o` files | every BPF map/program/helper the old kernel cannot load, with the kver-gated ones marked skipped |
| `hybrid-bootimg.sh` | before the first boot | new kernel + old *recovery* ramdisk: recovery/fastbootd on the candidate kernel, so the phone stays reachable |
| `init-harness.sh` | from that recovery | the new ramdisk's `/init` run as PID 1 of a throwaway pidns on the live kernel; each FATAL in kmsg is a gap, no slot-retry burnt. Covers bionic → `selinux_setup` → start of second stage |
| `dtbo-ramoops-alt.py` | for anything past that | a debug dtbo whose live ramoops ring survives a clean reboot; normal-boot, then read it from recovery — the only way to see `early-init` die (cgroups, apexd-bootstrap) on a device whose bootloader wipes pstore |
| `pstore-pull.sh` | from recovery, after | every pstore record, plus the raw ring unrolled if the kernel did not expose it; `pmsg-ramoops-*` decoded to logcat text (`pmsg-decode.py`) |
| `pixel-ramoops-pull.sh` | Pixel 3/3a class, after a *panic* | the encrypted klog the bootloader saved, decrypted with your own key |
| `super-loop-mount.sh` | from recovery | a logical partition of the inactive slot mounted rw without device-mapper — edit `init.rc`, push a binary, chroot into it |
| `usb-watch.sh` | during a boot attempt | timestamped USB/adb/fastboot transitions: how long until the bootloader, whether adbd ever appeared |

## Assessing a port

`OLD_SRC` is a checkout on a branch where the device built; `NEW_SRC` is the target branch. Both
must be on disk. Keep the old tree until the port lands.

```sh
# What does upstream no longer give this SoC?
./tools/check-platform-support.sh <NEW_SRC> device/<vendor>/<codename>

# Which SELinux types did the new branch delete?
./tools/find-orphaned-sepolicy-types.sh <OLD_SRC> <NEW_SRC> device/<vendor>/<codename>

# Which C/C++ constants did it lose?
./tools/find-removed-platform-symbols.sh <OLD_SRC> <NEW_SRC> device/<vendor>/<codename>

# Which namespaces, modules, blob dependencies and include paths did it move or delete?
# (OLD tree's device dir as 4th arg when NEW_SRC has no synced device tree yet; EXTRA_TREES for sibling blob dirs)
EXTRA_TREES="vendor/<vendor>/<sibling>" ./tools/find-soong-namespace-drift.sh <OLD_SRC> <NEW_SRC> device/<vendor>/<codename> [<OLD_SRC>/device/<vendor>/<codename>]
```

Each `[OUT]` gate means the device no longer gets whatever that block configures. The three outputs
are the work list.

## Triaging a build

```sh
mka -k -j12 bacon 2>&1 | tee build.log     # -k keeps going and collects every failure
./tools/triage-build-log.sh build.log      # collapse them into classes
```

Use `-k` on a new port: failures cluster. A run reporting 274 failed edges resolved to two fixes,
270 of them a single missing BoardConfig flag.

## When packaging fails

```sh
./tools/check-image-labels.sh <SRC> <codename> device/<vendor>/<codename> [<reference-out>]
```

`e2fsdroid` refuses to build `system.img` unless every path has a label, reports one path per run,
and fails at ~99% of the build. Pass a `REFERENCE_OUT` from a device that builds to filter benign
cases.

## Why these exist

Porting to a newer branch fails one way: upstream deleted something the device tree still
references, silently. The providing block is gated behind a platform list that no longer names the
SoC, or a header dropped the constant. The build then fails far from the cause, one item per run,
because `checkpolicy` and the compiler stop at the first error.

## Worked example: ether, lineage-18.1 → 19.1

What the tools report, on a real port:

| Tool | What it would have said up front |
|---|---|
| `check-platform-support.sh` | `device/qcom/sepolicy-legacy/SEPolicy.mk` no longer lists `msm8992`, so the whole legacy qcom vendor policy is gone. Also flags the inverted `BOARD_SEPOLICY_M4DEFS` gate — the reason importing a newer vendor policy trips AOSP neverallows. |
| `find-orphaned-sepolicy-types.sh` | `adsprpcd_file`, `qdisplay_service`, `sysfs_graphics`, `perfd`, `debugfs_rmt`, `time_data_file`, … — six build cycles' worth, in one pass. |
| `find-removed-platform-symbols.sh` | AOSP 12 dropped the vendor section of `system/camera.h`; the bundled QCamera2 HAL uses eight of those constants. |
| `find-soong-namespace-drift.sh` | 22.2→24.0 on a Pixel 3a: five `hardware/google/pixel/*` subdirs became namespaces the device never imported; `hardware/qcom/wlan` gained a namespace that shadows the imported `legacy` one; dumpstate 1.1, health.storage 1.0, `hardware.google.light@1.0-service`, `check_dynamic_partitions`, `disable_configstore` gone; the fingerprint blob links `android.frameworks.stats@1.0`, deleted; `vendor/lineage/config/device_framework_matrix.xml` moved. Seven build cycles, one pass. |
| `triage-build-log.sh` | 274 edges → `BUILD_BROKEN_ELF_PREBUILT_PRODUCT_COPY_FILES` + a kernel toolchain flag. |

## Fixing what they find

Restore, do not redesign. Copy the original definition and its context entry verbatim from the old
tree:

- a SELinux type without its `file_contexts` / `genfs_contexts` / `property_contexts` line parses
  fine and labels nothing, so the domain is inert at runtime;
- a C constant must keep its original value — prebuilt blobs and the framework already agree on those
  numbers, so renumbering breaks the ABI silently. Put them in a device-local compat header
  force-included via `LOCAL_CFLAGS += -include <header>`, which leaves vendor sources diffable
  against upstream.

Script-writing traps that produced wrong answers here are collected in **GOTCHAS 17**.

## The pieces that are not in `tools/`

Not everything the forge runs lives here. These get invoked for you, but they are where a build
actually fails, so they are worth knowing by name.

| | |
|---|---|
| `bootstrap.sh` | the orchestrator — reads `device.conf`, then `device.conf.local` if present, syncs, applies the overlay, builds |
| `lib/presets.sh` | resolves a preset name into an option list and a build tag. `EXTRA_OPTIONS` is unioned in here, and the tag suffix for each option it adds (`-oem`, `-nextcloud`) is derived here rather than written by hand |
| `docker/prefetch.sh` | downloads the build's network inputs into `/dl` in-container, so they overlap `repo sync` instead of running after it. A set-but-failed download is fatal, deliberately |
| `docker/_build_rom.sh` | runs the build inside the container and calls each enabled option's `require.sh` before and `post-build.sh` after |
| `prebuilt/lib-fdroid.sh` | the F-Droid fetch: resolves the suggested build of a package, verifies package name, ABI and the pinned signer certificate, unpacks native libraries the APK packs compressed, writes the Soong module file |
| `prebuilt/fetch-firefox.sh`, `fetch-fulguris.sh`, `fetch-fdroid.sh`, `fetch-k9.sh`, `fetch-kdeconnect.sh`, `fetch-termoneplus.sh`, `fetch-nextcloud.sh`, `fetch-linphone.sh`, `fetch-connectbot.sh`, `fetch-syncthing-fork.sh` | the per-option fetchers on top of it: package, signer pin, module names |
| `prebuilt/lib-app-checks.sh` | the `require.sh` / `post-build.sh` checks those options share: APKs present and named in the module file; shipped byte-identical, libraries installed beside |
| `prebuilt/fetch-magisk.sh` | downloads Magisk for the `root` option's boot-image patch |

An option can also carry its own hooks, which `_build_rom.sh` runs by name:

- `require.sh` — before the build. Non-zero stops it. `gapps` uses this to refuse a build whose app
  swaps were never staged, rather than shipping Lineage's apps under a GApps tag.
- `post-build.sh` — after a successful build. Non-zero fails it. `root` patches the boot image here;
  `firefox` checks the APK it shipped can still install.
