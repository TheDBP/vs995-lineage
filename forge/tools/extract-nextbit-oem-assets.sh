#!/bin/bash
# extract-nextbit-oem-assets.sh — reclaim the Nextbit Robin OEM assets (system sounds, wallpapers,
# boot animation) from a Nextbit Robin stock ROM and bake them into the tree being built.
#
#   ./extract-nextbit-oem-assets.sh <Ether_Stock_ROM.zip> [AOSP_ROOT]
#
# SCOPE: this handles exactly one asset pack -- the Nextbit Robin (ether) stock ROM, Android 7.
# It is not a general OEM extractor and will not work on other manufacturers' firmware. Modern OEM
# ROMs ship a payload.bin rather than a flat zip, put system in a dynamic super.img, and scatter
# assets across /product and /system_ext; none of that is handled here. Generic extraction is being
# developed separately: https://github.com/TheDBP/extract-oem-assets
#
# WHICH DEVICE IS BEING BUILT DOES NOT MATTER. The constraint is the *input*: any build may opt into
# this pack by setting OEM_ASSET_PACK=nextbit-robin, which is how the Pixel build borrows the Robin
# boot animation. The script verifies the zip really is a Nextbit ROM and refuses otherwise, so
# pointing it at a Pixel factory image fails loudly instead of silently baking nothing.
#
# The assets are PROPRIETARY (Nextbit), extracted from YOUR copy of the stock ROM. They are
# gitignored and never committed. AOSP_ROOT defaults to /aosp. Idempotent.

# no other density in the APK. Any device that isn't xxhdpi upscales a tiny bitmap, and even the
# Robin downscales it (it reports density 420, so the 480-bucket asset is resampled by 0.875).
# The PNGs are also flat white with an alpha channel, so they cannot be tinted and stay white
# regardless of the nav bar's theme.
#
# They turned out to be one annulus cut three ways, which redraws exactly as vectors. The
# replacements are the nav-icons build option (forge/options/nav-icons): scalable, tintable, drawn
# from scratch rather than lifted from someone's firmware.
