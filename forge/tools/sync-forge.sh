# Replaces `git subtree`. Subtree linkage lives in COMMIT MESSAGES (git-subtree-dir /
# git-subtree-split trailers), so squashing a repo's history destroys it and every squash would
# need a re-link. This keeps forge/ as ordinary vendored files — squash-proof — and records the
# upstream commit in forge/FORGE_REF so "which forge is this?" is one grep, not archaeology.
#
# Local edits to forge/ are NOT preserved: the sync is an exact mirror (rsync --delete), EXCEPT
# fetched prebuilt/*.apk artifacts, which are gitignored and would otherwise be wiped. Forge
# changes belong upstream in rom-forge first, then come back down through here.
